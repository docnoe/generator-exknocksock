# Work in progress!
I personally use coffee-script exclusively and only tested the coffee-script templates.

Feel free to (re)add js and ts templates.

# generator-exknocksock
Yeoman generator to setup an app with express, socket.io and knockout.js. Based on the fabulous generator-ko by Steve Sanderson.

Creating SPAs with knockout.js rocks! Especially when it's models are populated by socket.io. 

## Backend
Using Express.oi for the backend makes realtime routing possible.

## Frontend
Knockout.js + requirejs + gulp = a breece to greate modular SPAs.
